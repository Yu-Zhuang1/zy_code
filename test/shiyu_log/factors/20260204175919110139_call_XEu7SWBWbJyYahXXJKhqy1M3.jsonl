{"role": "system", "content": "\n\n# General Objective\n\nYou accomplish a given task iteratively, breaking it down into clear steps and working through them methodically.\n\n## Task Strategy\n\n1. Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user won't provide any tool-use feedback. You must reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed by yourself. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n5. No matter what the user requests, please always gather information and analyze as much as possible, before providing an answer.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each response must involve one tool call, unless the task is already solved. Sending back a response without a tool call is STRICTLY forbidden, unless the task is already solved.**\n2. **IMPORTANT: After each tool call, you must pause, think and reflect the results, your current plan, and take the next step. You may modify your plan according to the tool call results provided to you.**\n3. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n4. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n5. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n6. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n7. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n8. **IMPORTANT: Do include the tool call with the tool_calls in your response sent back, as a dedicated item in your response, which follows the OpenAI's tool call communication rules. Note that it is NOT in the text content of your response that you should include your tool_calls, but in the tool_calls attribute of your response.**\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The actual tool results in will be provided to you after the tool call is executed, with the role of the message being 'tool'.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n\n# Agent Specific Objective\n\nYou are an agent that specializes in analyzing and predicting events in **finance**.\n\n## File Path Handling\nWhen subtasks mention file paths, these are local system file paths (not sandbox paths). You can:\n- Use tools to directly access these files from the local system\n- Upload files to the sandbox environment (remember to create a new sandbox for each task, this sandbox only exists for the current task) for processing if needed\n- Choose the most appropriate approach based on the specific task requirements\n- If the final response requires returning a file, download it to the local system first and then return the local path, the sandbox path is not allowed\n\nCritically assess the reliability of all information:\n- If the credibility of a source is uncertain, clearly flag it.\n- Do **not** treat information as trustworthy just because it appears — **cross-check when necessary**.\n- If you find conflicting or ambiguous information, include all relevant findings and flag the inconsistency.\n\nBe cautious and transparent in your output:\n- Always return all related information. If information is incomplete or weakly supported, still share partial excerpts, and flag any uncertainty.\n- Never assume or guess — if an exact answer cannot be found, say so clearly.\n- Prefer quoting or excerpting **original source text** rather than interpreting or rewriting it, and provide the URL if available.\n- If more context is needed, return a clarification request and do not proceed with tool use.\n- Focus on completing the specific subtask assigned to you, not broader reasoning.\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}

(CIK 1018724) Form 8-K Filings as of February 5, 2026\n\n#### Key Observations:\n1. **No Filings for February 5–6, 2026**:  \n   The provided data includes **no filings dated February 5–6, 2026**. The most recent filing in the dataset is dated **November 20, 2025** (Item 8.01 and 9.01). All other filings in the table are from **2021–2025**, with no entries for January–February 2026.\n\n2. **No Q4 2025 Earnings Release Filed**:  \n   - Q4 2025 (ended December 31, 2025) earnings releases would typically be filed in **January or February 2026**.  \n   - The dataset contains **no filings after November 20, 2025**, so **no 8-K for Q4 2025 earnings is present** in the provided data.  \n   - The latest earnings-related filings (e.g., with **Item 2.02** for \"Results of Operations and Financial Condition\") are:  \n     - **February 6, 2025**: Items 2.02 and 9.01 (likely Q4 2024 earnings, as this would correspond to the quarter ending December 31, 2024).  \n     - All other Item 2.02 filings predate November 2025 and thus relate to prior quarters (e.g., Q3 2024 or earlier).\n\n3. **Exhibit Links and GAAP Diluted EPS**:  \n   - The dataset **only provides the table of filings** (filing dates, descriptions, and links to document indexes).  \n   - **No content of the actual filings** (e.g., EX-99.1 exhibits, earnings details, or GAAP diluted EPS mentions) is included in the provided data.  \n   - Even if a Q4 2025 earnings release existed, the data lacks the ability to extract exhibit links or specific financial metrics from the filings themselves.\n\n#### Conclusion:  \n- **No relevant filings exist for February 5–6, 2026** in this dataset.  \n- **No Q4 2025 earnings release is documented** here, as the data stops at November 2025.  \n- To analyze Q4 2025 earnings, the prediction agent should check for **new filings after December 31, 2025** (likely January/February 2026) on the SEC EDGAR database.

It is solely an **announcement of the upcoming earnings release date** (February 5, 2026), which has not yet occurred as of the article's publication date (January 22, 2026).  \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **No earnings data is present**:  \n   - The article states: *\"Amazon will share its Q4 and 2025 financial results on February 5\"* and *\"Amazon will hold a conference call to discuss its Q4 2025 and full year 2025 financial results on February 5 at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET.\"*  \n   - **No specific financial figures** (e.g., net income, diluted EPS) are included because the results have not been released yet.  \n\n2. **No links to press releases, shareholder letters, or SEC filings**:  \n   - The only relevant link is to [www.amazon.com/ir](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fir&esheet=53884885&newsitemid=20240118568335&lan=en-US&anchor=www.amazon.com%2Fir&index=1&md5=4c0e1e90922118b7c8ab82daebca275d), which directs to Amazon’s Investor Relations page. However, this is **not a direct link to a press release or SEC filing**—it is a general portal where earnings materials will be posted *after* February 5, 2026.  \n   - The article explicitly states: *\"The event will be webcast live, and the audio and associated slides will be available for at least three months thereafter at [www.amazon.com/ir](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fir&esheet=53884885&newsitemid=20240118568335&lan=en-US&anchor=www.amazon.com%2Fir&index=1&md5=4c0e1e90922118b7c8ab82daebca275d).\"*  \n     → This confirms the materials will be posted **after** the February 5 release date, not before.  \n\n3. **No mention of net income or diluted EPS**:  \n   - There are **zero sentences** in the article discussing actual financial metrics (e.g., \"GAAP diluted EPS,\" \"net income,\" etc.). The content is purely procedural (announcing the date of the upcoming earnings release).  \n\n4. **Related content references outdated or irrelevant information**:  \n   - The link to *\"Read Amazon's Q3 2025 earnings report\"* points to a prior report (Q3 2025), which is unrelated to Q4 2025 results.  \n   - The \"Trending news\" and \"More Amazon News\" sections discuss unrelated topics (Prime Video content, leadership updates, grocery delivery), not earnings results.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nThis article **does not contain any earnings data** for Q4 2025 or FY2025.
