{"role": "system", "content": "\n\n# General Objective\n\nYou accomplish a given task iteratively, breaking it down into clear steps and working through them methodically.\n\n## Task Strategy\n\n1. Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user won't provide any tool-use feedback. You must reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed by yourself. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n5. No matter what the user requests, please always gather information and analyze as much as possible, before providing an answer.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each response must involve one tool call, unless the task is already solved. Sending back a response without a tool call is STRICTLY forbidden, unless the task is already solved.**\n2. **IMPORTANT: After each tool call, you must pause, think and reflect the results, your current plan, and take the next step. You may modify your plan according to the tool call results provided to you.**\n3. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n4. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n5. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n6. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n7. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n8. **IMPORTANT: Do include the tool call with the tool_calls in your response sent back, as a dedicated item in your response, which follows the OpenAI's tool call communication rules. Note that it is NOT in the text content of your response that you should include your tool_calls, but in the tool_calls attribute of your response.**\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The actual tool results in will be provided to you after the tool call is executed, with the role of the message being 'tool'.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n\n# Agent Specific Objective\n\nYou are an agent that specializes in analyzing and predicting events in **finance**.\n\n## File Path Handling\nWhen subtasks mention file paths, these are local system file paths (not sandbox paths). You can:\n- Use tools to directly access these files from the local system\n- Upload files to the sandbox environment (remember to create a new sandbox for each task, this sandbox only exists for the current task) for processing if needed\n- Choose the most appropriate approach based on the specific task requirements\n- If the final response requires returning a file, download it to the local system first and then return the local path, the sandbox path is not allowed\n\nCritically assess the reliability of all information:\n- If the credibility of a source is uncertain, clearly flag it.\n- Do **not** treat information as trustworthy just because it appears — **cross-check when necessary**.\n- If you find conflicting or ambiguous information, include all relevant findings and flag the inconsistency.\n\nBe cautious and transparent in your output:\n- Always return all related information. If information is incomplete or weakly supported, still share partial excerpts, and flag any uncertainty.\n- Never assume or guess — if an exact answer cannot be found, say so clearly.\n- Prefer quoting or excerpting **original source text** rather than interpreting or rewriting it, and provide the URL if available.\n- If more context is needed, return a clarification request and do not proceed with tool use.\n- Focus on completing the specific subtask assigned to you, not broader reasoning.\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}

Our investment in Rivian's preferred stock was accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, prior to Rivian's initial public offering in November 2021, which resulted in the conversion of our preferred stock to Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2024, we held 158 million shares of Rivian's Class A common stock, representing an approximate 14% ownership interest, and an approximate 13% voting interest. We determined that we have the ability to exercise significant influence over Rivian through our equity investment, our commercial arrangement for the purchase of electric vehicles and jointly-owned intellectual property, and one of our employees serving on Rivian's board of directors. We elected the fair value option to account for our equity investment in Rivian, which is included in \"Marketable securities\" on our consolidated balance sheets, and had a fair value of $3.7 billion and $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024. The investment was subject to regulatory sales restrictions resulting in a discount for lack of marketability of approximately $800 million as of December 31, 2021, which expired in Q1 2022.\n```\n\n### Impact on GAAP Net Income/EPS\nThe Rivian investment valuation changes directly affected Amazon's GAAP net income. Specifically, the $(1.6) billion loss in 2024 from the Rivian investment contributed significantly to the $(2.25) billion total other expense reported for the year. This would have reduced both net income and EPS by approximately $1.51 billion (after tax impact) or $0.14 per diluted share in 2024 (based on $10.721 million diluted shares).\n\n## Restructuring Charges\n\n### 2022 Restructuring Activities\n```\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded approximately $1.1 billion, of which $720 million was recorded in the fourth quarter, of impairments of property and equipment and operating leases primarily related to physical stores. These charges were recorded in \"Other operating expense (income), net\" and primarily impacted our North America segment. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we also recorded expenses of approximately $480 million, primarily in \"Fulfillment,\" primarily relating to terminating contracts for certain leases not yet commenced as well as other purchase commitments, which primarily impacted our North America segment.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded approximately $720 million, of which $640 million was recorded in the fourth quarter, of estimated severance costs primarily related to planned role eliminations. These charges were recorded primarily in \"Technology and infrastructure,\" \"Fulfillment,\" and \"General and administrative\" and primarily impacted our North America segment.\n\nCharges for impairment, expenses for terminating contracts and other commitments, and severance costs were not material to our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024.\n```\n\n## Litigation/Settlements\n\n### Key Legal Proceedings\n```\nThe Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following:\n\nIn March 2023, the plaintiffs alleged in their damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $140 million to $267 million in damages [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute case]. In March 2024, the district court granted summary judgment ruling that the patent is invalid and dismissed the case. In April 2024, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal.\n\nIn April 2024, a jury found that Amazon infringed the asserted patents and awarded Kove $525 million in damages. In August 2024, the court awarded Kove $148 million in pre-judgment interest. In September 2024, we filed a notice of appeal.\n\nBeginning in June 2019 with Wilcosky v. Amazon.com, Inc., private litigants have filed a number of cases in U.S. federal and state courts alleging, among other things, that Amazon's collection, storage, use, retention, and protection of biometric identifiers violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. The complaints seek certification as class actions, unspecified amounts of damages, injunctive relief, attorneys' fees, costs, and interest.\n\nBeginning in March 2020 with Frame-Wilson v. Amazon.com, Inc. filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, private litigants have filed a number of cases in the U.S. and Canada alleging, among other things, price fixing arrangements between Amazon.com, Inc. and vendors and third-party sellers in Amazon's stores, monopolization and attempted monopolization, and consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims. The complaints seek billions of dollars of alleged damages, treble damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, civil penalties, attorneys' fees, and costs.\n\nIn October 2020, Broadband iTV, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon.com Services LLC, and Amazon Web Services, Inc. alleging patent infringement related to Amazon Prime Video features and services. In April 2022, Broadband iTV alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $166 million to $986 million in damages.\n\nIn July 2021, the Luxembourg National Commission for Data Protection (the \"CNPD\") issued a decision against Amazon Europe Core S.à r.l. claiming that Amazon's processing of personal data did not comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation. The decision imposes a fine of €746 million and corresponding practice revisions.\n\nIn December 2021, the Italian Competition Authority (the \"ICA\") issued a decision against Amazon Services Europe S.à r.l., Amazon Europe Core S.à r.l., Amazon EU S.à r.l., Amazon Italia Services S.r.l., and Amazon Italia Logistica S.r.l. claiming that certain of our marketplace and logistics practices in Italy infringe EU competition rules. The decision imposes remedial actions and a fine of €1.13 billion, which we have paid and will seek to recover pending conclusion of all appeals.\n\nBeginning in October 2023, Nokia Technologies Oy and related entities filed complaints alleging infringement of patents related to video-related technologies against Amazon.com, Inc. and related entities in multiple courts in the United States, India, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Brazil, the Unified Patent Court of the European Union, and the United States International Trade Commission. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief and, in some cases, unspecified money damages, enhanced damages, attorneys' fees, costs, interest, and declaratory relief.\n```\n\n## Foreign Exchange Impacts\n\n### Foreign Exchange Risk Overview\n```\nOur financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant.\n\nIn addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons.\n```\n\n### Quantified Impact on Results\n```\nInformation regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. The effect on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income from changes in our foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions):\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 Year Ended December 31, 2024\nAs Reported Exchange Rate Effect (1)At Prior Year Rates(2)As Reported Exchange Rate Effect (1)At Prior Year Rates(2)\nNet sales$574,785$71$574,856$637,959$2,335$640,294\nOperating expenses 537,933 531 538,464 569,366 2,466 571,832\nOperating income 36,852(460)36,392 68,593(131)68,462\n```\n\n### Specific Foreign Exchange Risk Details\n```\nDuring 2024, net sales from our International segment accounted for 22% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales decreased by $1.8 billion in comparison with the prior year.\n\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (\"foreign funds\"). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2024, of $25.5 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in declines of $1.3 billion, $2.6 billion, and $5.1 billion.\n\nAdditionally, we have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2024, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of $305 million, $605 million, and $1.2 billion, recorded to \"Other income (expense), net.\"\n```", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}

That differs from the **11-quarter GAAP beat streak** implied by the Finviz GAAP table (because **2022Q4 is a GAAP miss** there).

Future settlements can be large, discrete GAAP hits.  \nSources: 10-K link above; CNBC Q3 results link above.\n\n---\n\n# Bottom line for the “> $1.95 diluted GAAP EPS” question (evidence-weighted)\n- **Consensus GAAP EPS is clustered very near the threshold**: roughly **$1.96–$1.97** from sources that explicitly show GAAP-context estimates (Seeking Alpha GAAP estimate **$1.96**; Finviz GAAP estimate **1.9697**; Barron’s/FactSet avg **$1.97**, range **$1.61–$2.41**).  \n  - SA: https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN/earnings  \n  - Finviz: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN&ty=fc  \n  - Barron’s/FactSet: https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/amzn/research-ratings?mod=quotes\n- **Recent GAAP execution has been strong**: **11 straight GAAP EPS beats** (per the Finviz GAAP table), and **~74% beat rate** since 2019Q1 in that same dataset. https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN&ty=fc\n- **Key swing risks for GAAP EPS** into Q4 FY2025 remain: **equity valuation (Rivian), FX remeasurement, and legal/restructuring items** (10-K), though Q4 guidance language assumes **no additional** acquisitions/restructurings/legal settlements (Business Wire).\n\nIf you want, I can also re-express the above into a simple “distance-to-threshold” view (e.g., consensus minus $1.95; what size miss would flip it) using only the cited numbers.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}

https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN&ty=fc\n\n---\n\n## 3) Long-run GAAP EPS beat/miss frequency (web-sourced)\n\n### 3.1 Beat/miss rate from the accessible Finviz GAAP history (2019Q1–2025Q3)\nUsing the Finviz GAAP EPS table entries visible in-session (2019Q1 through 2025Q3):\n\n- **Beats:** 20  \n- **Misses:** 7  \n- **Meets:** 0  \n- **Total quarters counted:** 27  \n- **Beat rate:** ~**74%**  \n- **Most recent GAAP beat streak implied by that table:** **11 consecutive beats** (from **2023Q1** through **2025Q3**, with **2022Q4** a miss).  \nUnderlying source table: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN&ty=fc\n\n### 3.2 Conflicting “streak” claim found (not GAAP-specified)\nA Nasdaq-hosted Motley Fool–syndicated article states:\n> “Amazon has a **12-quarter** streak of beating Wall Street’s earnings-per-share estimates.”  \nIt does **not** specify GAAP vs adjusted, and it conflicts with the Finviz GAAP table’s implication (11 straight GAAP beats because 2022Q4 was a GAAP miss there).  \nCitation: https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-you-buy-amazon-stock-feb-5-0\n\n**Conclusion:** Beat-rate evidence is strong, but “streak length” is **dataset/definition-sensitive** (GAAP vs adjusted; provider differences).\n\n---\n\n## 4) Guidance / management commentary relevant to FY2025 Q4 GAAP EPS\n\n### 4.1 Official Q4 FY2025 Outlook from Amazon’s Q3 FY2025 release (Business Wire)\nKey guidance that directly informs GAAP operating income (and indirectly EPS), plus explicit FX assumption:\n\n- Net sales:\n  > “Net sales are expected to be between **$206.0 billion and $213.0 billion**… This guidance anticipates a **favorable impact of approximately 190 basis points from foreign exchange rates**.”  \n- Operating income:\n  > “Operating income is expected to be between **$21.0 billion and $26.0 billion**…”  \n- Guidance caveat on one-time items:\n  > “This guidance assumes… that **no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements** are concluded.”  \nCitation: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251029099339/en/Amazon.com-Announces-Third-Quarter-Results\n\nAlso on Q3 diluted EPS (helps anchor run-rate expectations):\n> “Net income increased to $21.2 billion in the third quarter, or **$1.95 per diluted share**…”  \nCitation: same Business Wire link above.\n\n### 4.2 CNBC management commentary context (Q3 FY2025 results; Q4 guidance; one-time charges)\nCNBC (Oct 30, 2025) reiterates Q4 ranges and notes Q3 operating income included large discrete charges:\n\n- Q4 sales: **$206B–$213B**  \n- Q4 operating income: **$21B–$26B**  \n- Q3 included:\n  > “$2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission”  \n  and:\n  > “about $1.8 billion in severance costs…”  \n- Also notes guidance uncertainty from tariffs/trade policy (qualitative risk factor).  \nCitation: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/amazon-amzn-q3-earnings-report-2025.html\n\n### 4.3 Reuters summary extracted in-session (conflict flagged)\nA Reuters page read during the session stated Q4 net sales guidance **$206B–$213B** and referenced one-time charges, but the extracted summary included a **“$25 billion” FTC settlement charge**, which **directly conflicts** with CNBC and Business Wire (both indicate **$2.5B**, not $25B).  \nBecause of that inconsistency, treat the Reuters-extracted “$25B” figure as **likely erroneous in the accessible extract** and **not reliable** versus CNBC/Business Wire.  \n(Reuters link that was read:

driven by **equity security valuations** (including Rivian) and **FX**, which can swing GAAP net income/EPS.\n\nFrom the 10-K (yearly data, but mechanism directly affects quarterly GAAP):\n- “Other income (expense), net… primary components… related to equity securities valuations and adjustments… and foreign currency.”  \n- “Included… in 2023 and 2024… a… valuation gain (loss)… from our equity investment in **Rivian**.”  \n- Quantification:\n  > “Included in other income (expense), net in 2023 and 2024 is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of **$797 million** and **$(1.6) billion** from our equity investment in Rivian.”  \n- Component table excerpt (millions):\n  - Marketable equity securities valuation gains (losses): **$(13,870)** (2022), **$984** (2023), **$(1,278)** (2024)  \n  - Foreign currency gains (losses): **$(340)** (2022), **$65** (2023), **$(408)** (2024)  \n  - Total other income (expense), net: **$(16,806)** (2022), **$938** (2023), **$(2,250)** (2024)  \nCitation: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872425000004/amzn-20241231.htm\n\n**Relevance:** Even if Q4 operating results are strong, GAAP diluted EPS can be pushed above/below $1.95 by **below-the-line** valuation/FX effects.\n\n### 5.2 FX exposure (including remeasurement of intercompany balances)\nSame 10-K highlights:\n- “Changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results…”  \n- “Remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses…”  \n- Quantified sensitivity example (intercompany balances):\n  > “an assumed 10% adverse change… would result in losses of **$605 million**, recorded to ‘Other income (expense), net.’”  \nCitation: same SEC 10-K link above.\n\nAlso Q4 guidance assumes **~190 bps favorable FX impact** to net sales (Business Wire).  \nCitation: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251029099339/en/Amazon.com-Announces-Third-Quarter-Results\n\n### 5.3 Restructuring/severance and legal settlements\n- Q3 FY2025 included **$1.8B severance** and **$2.5B FTC settlement** (CNBC).  \nCitation: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/amazon-amzn-q3-earnings-report-2025.html\n- Q4 guidance explicitly assumes **no additional… restructurings, or legal settlements** (Business Wire).  \nCitation: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251029099339/en/Amazon.com-Announces-Third-Quarter-Results\n- The 10-K describes restructuring charge types (impairments, lease terminations, severance) and extensive legal proceedings that can create episodic GAAP hits.  \nCitation: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872425000004/amzn-20241231.htm\n\n---\n\n## 6) What this implies for the **“GAAP diluted EPS > $1.95”** question (evidence-based synthesis)\n\n**Evidence pointing toward “Yes” (but close):**\n- The most GAAP-explicit consensus values found (Seeking Alpha GAAP estimate **$1.96**; Finviz GAAP estimate **1.9697**) are **slightly above** $1.95.  \n  - SA: https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN/earnings  \n  - Finviz: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN&ty=fc\n- Long-run GAAP beat frequency from an accessible GAAP dataset is strong (**~74% beats** since 2019Q1) with a recent GAAP beat streak (**11 straight** per Finviz GAAP table).  \n  - Finviz: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN&ty=fc\n- Q4 operating income guidance is high (**$21B–$26B**) and includes a stated FX tailwind (**~190 bps** to net sales).  \n  - Business Wire: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251029099339/en/Amazon.com-Announces-Third-Quarter-Results\n\n**Evidence increasing uncertainty / “No” risk:**\n- The threshold is **tight**: consensus centers around **~$1.96–$1.97**, so relatively modest negative variance can flip the outcome.\n- GAAP EPS can be materially affected by **Rivian valuation**, **FX remeasurement**, and **legal/restructuring** items (10-K).  \n  - SEC 10-K: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872425000004/amzn-20241231.htm\n- Some sources (MarketBeat, Zacks) cite similar EPS levels but do **not** clearly specify GAAP vs adjusted, limiting their direct comparability to a GAAP-diluted threshold.\n\n**Educated guess based on the session’s evidence:** **Slightly more likely than not (“Lean Yes”)**, but it is a **near-consensus coin-flip** because estimates cluster just above **$1.95** and GAAP volatility items can swing results.\n\n---\n\n## 7) Data access issues / missing items (important for downstream work)\nDuring this session, several “major source” pages were not retrievable in full due to access restrictions:\n- **Yahoo Finance AMZN “Analysis” page** (often includes avg/low/high and analyst count) returned HTTP errors in this run, despite Google snippets showing “Low 1.61 / High 2.41 / Avg 1.96” style fields.\n- **TipRanks** pages returned **403/CAPTCHA**.\n- **Investing.com**

GAAP EPS history  \n   - Computed beat/miss counts (20/7/0 over 27 quarters) and implied beat streak (11) based on the extracted table values.\n\n---\n\n## Final takeaway (decision-relevant)\n- **Consensus GAAP EPS for FY2025 Q4 is slightly above $1.95** in the best GAAP-labeled sources accessible here (**~$1.96–$1.97**).  \n- Amazon has shown a **high GAAP beat frequency** in the accessible long-run dataset (**~74%** since 2019Q1).  \n- However, **GAAP EPS volatility** from **Rivian valuation**, **FX remeasurement**, and **legal/restructuring** items can overwhelm small margins around a $1.95 threshold.  \n\n**Therefore:** **Lean Yes**, but **tight**.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}
