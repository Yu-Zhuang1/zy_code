The ESPN pregame snippet says \"Blue Jackets: None listed. Flyers: None listed\" but the Sportsbook Wire has specific injuries - maybe the ESPN pregame is for the Blue Jackets game on Jan 27? No, the URL is correct for Jan 28. Let me open both the ESPN pregame and Sportsbook Wire to compare.\n\nActually, let me open the Sportsbook Wire injury report link first, as it's from Jan 27 (7 hours ago) so it should be accurate for the Jan 28 game. Then open the Bleacher Nation prediction for the betting details, and the NHL gamecenter for the final result.\n</think>\n\n<use_mcp_tool>\n<server_name>tool-google-search</server_name>\n<tool_name>google_search</tool_name>\n<arguments>\n{\"q\": \"Sportsbook Wire injury report Jan 28 2026 Blue Jackets Flyers\"}\n</arguments>\n</use_mcp_tool>"

Maybe one is local time and one is EST? No, the Sportsnet link says EST.\n\nWait, the Sportsnet snippet: \"Wed Jan 28 4:30 pm\" which matches the Fox Sports prediction snippet: \"Jan 28 2026, 4:30 PM\". The NHL.com preview says 7:30 PM EST? No, wait the Sportsnet link says EST, but the ESPN live score said 4:30 PM. Let me check the Fox Sports prediction link for time, ESPN live score for time, and the official NHL gamecenter.\n\nWait, the Fox Sports prediction link (top story) says \"Jan 28 2026\" but not time. Let me open the Sportsnet game link to confirm the time.\n\nBut the key points: \n1. From the NHL.com preview: it's a Military Appreciation Night\n2. From Sportsbook Wire: injuries for both teams\n3. From Fox Sports prediction: Blue Jackets are favorites at -135, with computer picks of 4-3\n4. From ESPN live score: Blue Jackets are favorites at -135 moneyline\n\nWait, the position 5 in this search is wrong: it's from Jan 23. I need to focus on the Jan 28 specific sources:\n- NFL.com preview (NHL.com) from 6 hours ago\n- Sportsbook Wire injury report from 8 hours ago\n- Fox Sports prediction from 17 hours ago\n- ESPN live score from 3 hours ago\n\nWait, the gamecenter link (position 2: https://www.nhl.com/gamecenter/cbj-vs-phi/2026/01/28/2025020840) says \"7:30 PM EST\" in the snippet. The Sportsnet link says 4:30 PM. Let me open the Sportsnet game link (position 8: https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/games/11e306ca-4907-4a2b-8bd0-1107b5660c4b) to get the correct game time and status.\n\nActually, the Sportsnet link shows the game is happening today at 4:30 PM EST (Jan 28). But the gamecenter says 7:30 PM EST? No, wait the gamecenter link says \"7:30 PM EST\" but the snippet for position 2 says \"4:30 PM EST\"? Wait no, let me check the exact snippet for position 2 in this search: \"Columbus Blue Jackets vs. Philadelphia Flyers, Jan 28, 2026 ... 7:30 PM EST.\"\n\nI think the NHL.com preview might be wrong on time, or maybe the ESPN live score time is different. But let me focus on the reliable sources:\n\n- **Recent Form**: From ESPN and NHL preview\n- **Injuries**: From Sportsbook Wire (official injury report for this game)\n- **Predictions**: From Fox Sports and ESPN\n- **Context**: Military Appreciation Night from NHL preview\n\nWait, but I still need the game result.

No, PST is UTC-8, EST is UTC-5, so 4:30 PM PST is 7:30 PM EST, which matches!\n\nOkay, I have all the information now. Let me compile the answer:\n\n**Game Summary & Context**\n- Date: Wednesday, January 28, 2026\n- Time: 7:30 PM EST (4:30 PM PST)\n- Venue: Nationwide Arena in Columbus, Ohio\n- Context: Military Appreciation Night (Blue Jackets community page, NHL.com preview)\n\n**Recent Form**\n- From Bleacher Nation and ESPN: Blue Jackets won three straight games; Flyers have three wins in last five games\n- This is a key Metropolitan Division matchup for points in the NHL standings\n\n**Current Injuries**\n- From Sportsbook Wire (game-specific report):\n  - Blue Jackets: Dante Fabbro (Defenseman, out, lower body injury)\n  - Flyers: Rodrigo Abols (Center, out, ankle), Tyson Foerster (Right Wing, out, upper body injury)\n- Goalie situation: Flyers' Daniel Vladar is listed as injured reserve\n\n**Predictions**\n- Favorites: Blue Jackets (-131 moneyline odds)\n- Spread: Blue Jackets -1.5 points\n- Total Goals: Under 6.5 goals (computer picks suggest under is more likely)\n- Best Bet: Under 6.5 goals and Blue Jackets to win by at least two points, with a 4-3 score prediction\n\n**Game Notes**\n- TV coverage: TNT (USA), ESPN+ and truTV for other regions\n- Key matchup: this is the fourth and final meeting between the two teams in the 2025-26 season\n\nWait, but let me confirm the injury report from Sportsbook Wire directly.
