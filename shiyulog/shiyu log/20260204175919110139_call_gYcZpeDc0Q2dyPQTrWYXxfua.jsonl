{"role": "system", "content": "\n\n# General Objective\n\nYou accomplish a given task iteratively, breaking it down into clear steps and working through them methodically.\n\n## Task Strategy\n\n1. Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user won't provide any tool-use feedback. You must reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed by yourself. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n5. No matter what the user requests, please always gather information and analyze as much as possible, before providing an answer.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each response must involve one tool call, unless the task is already solved. Sending back a response without a tool call is STRICTLY forbidden, unless the task is already solved.**\n2. **IMPORTANT: After each tool call, you must pause, think and reflect the results, your current plan, and take the next step. You may modify your plan according to the tool call results provided to you.**\n3. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n4. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n5. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n6. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n7. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n8. **IMPORTANT: Do include the tool call with the tool_calls in your response sent back, as a dedicated item in your response, which follows the OpenAI's tool call communication rules. Note that it is NOT in the text content of your response that you should include your tool_calls, but in the tool_calls attribute of your response.**\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The actual tool results in will be provided to you after the tool call is executed, with the role of the message being 'tool'.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n\n# Agent Specific Objective\n\nYou are an agent that specializes in analyzing and predicting events in **finance**.\n\n## File Path Handling\nWhen subtasks mention file paths, these are local system file paths (not sandbox paths). You can:\n- Use tools to directly access these files from the local system\n- Upload files to the sandbox environment (remember to create a new sandbox for each task, this sandbox only exists for the current task) for processing if needed\n- Choose the most appropriate approach based on the specific task requirements\n- If the final response requires returning a file, download it to the local system first and then return the local path, the sandbox path is not allowed\n\nCritically assess the reliability of all information:\n- If the credibility of a source is uncertain, clearly flag it.\n- Do **not** treat information as trustworthy just because it appears — **cross-check when necessary**.\n- If you find conflicting or ambiguous information, include all relevant findings and flag the inconsistency.\n\nBe cautious and transparent in your output:\n- Always return all related information. If information is incomplete or weakly supported, still share partial excerpts, and flag any uncertainty.\n- Never assume or guess — if an exact answer cannot be found, say so clearly.\n- Prefer quoting or excerpting **original source text** rather than interpreting or rewriting it, and provide the URL if available.\n- If more context is needed, return a clarification request and do not proceed with tool use.\n- Focus on completing the specific subtask assigned to you, not broader reasoning.\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}

Publication Date/Time:**  \n- **No publication date or time is available**, as the page does not exist.  \n\n**4. GAAP Diluted EPS Line:**  \n- **No financial data is present** in the page content (it is a 404 error page). The GAAP diluted EPS line or any earnings metrics cannot be extracted.  \n\n**5. URLs to Official Documents:**  \n- The error page contains **no direct links to specific earnings release PDFs, shareholder letters, 8-K filings, or 10-K/10-Q documents** related to the requested release.  \n- However, the page includes **generic site navigation links** (all pointing to Amazon’s Investor Relations sections):  \n  - [Annual reports, proxies and shareholder letters](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/annual-reports-proxies-and-shareholder-letters/default.aspx)  \n  - [Quarterly results](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/quarterly-results/default.aspx)  \n  - [SEC filings](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/sec-filings/default.aspx)  \n  - [Press releases](https://press.aboutamazon.com/)  \n  - [Contact us and request documents](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/contact-us-and-request-documents/default.aspx)  \n  - [Events](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/events/default.aspx)  \n- **Note**: These links are **not specific to the missing Q4 2025 release** and only lead to general sections of the IR site.

Thus, **Q4 2025 results will not be available until early 2026**.\n\n4. **Relevant Sections in Content**:  \n   - **Investor Relations navigation links** (all functional):  \n     - Annual reports, proxies, shareholder letters: `https://ir.aboutamazon.com/annual-reports-proxies-and-shareholder-letters/default.aspx`  \n     - Quarterly results: `https://ir.aboutamazon.com/quarterly-results/default.aspx`  \n     - SEC filings: `https://ir.aboutamazon.com/sec-filings/default.aspx`  \n     - Events: `https://ir.aboutamazon.com/events/default.aspx`  \n   - **Press center** (primary source for releases): `https://press.aboutamazon.com/`  \n   - **Contact support**: Email `support@q4inc.com` for site issues (relevant if 404 persists).\n\n5. **Additional Notes**:  \n   - The website is powered by **Q4 Inc.** (see footer: *\"Powered By Q4 Inc.5.172.0.2\"*).  \n   - Amazon’s primary investor relations hub is `https://ir.aboutamazon.com/`, but press releases are **separately hosted** at `https://press.aboutamazon.com/`.  \n   - No \"Page Not Found\" explanations or workarounds were provided beyond directing users to the site map or contact email.\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Next Steps for the Event Prediction Agent:\n1. **Verify News Source**:  \n   - Check `https://press.aboutamazon.com/` for actual press releases (this is the correct URL).  \n   - *Do not use* `https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/...` — it is broken.\n\n2. **Timing Context**:  \n   - Q4 2025 earnings will only be published in **January/February 2026**.  \n   - As of now, **no such release exists** — focus on historical patterns for prior years (e.g., Q4 2023 release date was January 25, 2024; Q4 2024 likely to be released in early 2025).\n\n3. **Monitor for Updates**:  \n   - Set up alerts for `https://press.aboutamazon.com/` starting **December 2025** to catch the Q4 2025 release when published.  \n   - Cross-reference with SEC filings (e.g., 8-K forms) for official earnings announcements.\n\n4. **Alternative Data Sources**:  \n   - Use `https://ir.aboutamazon.com/quarterly-results/default.aspx` for historical quarterly results data to extrapolate patterns.  \n   - Track Amazon’s \"Events\" page (`https://ir.aboutamazon.com/events/default.aspx`) for earnings call announcements.\n\n---\n\n### Key Takeaways:\n- **The provided URL is invalid** — use `https://press.aboutamazon.com/` for press releases.  \n- **No Q4 2025 earnings release exists yet** (it will be published in early 2026).  \n- Historical patterns suggest earnings are typically released **~4 weeks after quarter-end** (Q4 ends December 31 → release in late January/early February).  \n- Always verify URLs via Amazon’s official Investor Relations navigation (e.g., \"Press releases\" link in the footer).", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}

The page is purely a \"not found\" message with navigational links.  \n\n4. **Additional Context from the Error Page**:  \n   - Amazon’s official investor relations site appears to route press releases to `press.aboutamazon.com` (not `ir.aboutamazon.com/news-releases`).  \n   - The \"Events\" section (via `https://ir.aboutamazon.com/events/default.aspx`) might include scheduled earnings dates, but this URL was not tested in the current request (also returns a 404 in the provided content).  \n\n**Recommendations for Next Steps**:  \n- **Check `https://press.aboutamazon.com/` directly** for the latest press releases (likely where earnings announcements are published).  \n- Verify the **Events page** (`https://ir.aboutamazon.com/events/default.aspx`) for scheduled earnings call dates.  \n- Cross-reference **SEC Filings** (`https://ir.aboutamazon.com/sec-filings/default.aspx`) for Form 8-K submissions related to earnings.  \n- If the above links also fail, contact `support@q4inc.com` to report broken IR site paths.  \n\n**Critical Note**:  \n- The Q4 2025 earnings release (expected Feb 5, 2026) is **not yet published** as of the current data snapshot (since the page is broken and no future-dated announcements are visible). This aligns with typical timelines (earnings releases for Q4 2025 would not be published before year-end 2025). The error page does not contain any forward-looking earnings information.  \n\n**Useful URLs from the Error Page**:  \n- Press Releases: `https://press.aboutamazon.com/`  \n- SEC Filings: `https://ir.aboutamazon.com/sec-filings/default.aspx`  \n- Events: `https://ir.aboutamazon.com/events/default.aspx`  \n- Quarterly Results: `https://ir.aboutamazon.com/quarterly-results/default.aspx`  \n- Support Email: `support@q4inc.com`  \n\n**No actionable earnings release data exists in the provided content due to the 404 error.** The agent should prioritize checking the `press.aboutamazon.com` domain for accurate press releases.", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}

A 2026 earnings release page would not yet exist today, as it would cover results from a future period.
