{"role": "system", "content": "\n\n# General Objective\n\nYou accomplish a given task iteratively, breaking it down into clear steps and working through them methodically.\n\n## Task Strategy\n\n1. Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user won't provide any tool-use feedback. You must reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed by yourself. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n5. No matter what the user requests, please always gather information and analyze as much as possible, before providing an answer.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each response must involve one tool call, unless the task is already solved. Sending back a response without a tool call is STRICTLY forbidden, unless the task is already solved.**\n2. **IMPORTANT: After each tool call, you must pause, think and reflect the results, your current plan, and take the next step. You may modify your plan according to the tool call results provided to you.**\n3. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n4. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n5. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n6. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n7. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n8. **IMPORTANT: Do include the tool call with the tool_calls in your response sent back, as a dedicated item in your response, which follows the OpenAI's tool call communication rules. Note that it is NOT in the text content of your response that you should include your tool_calls, but in the tool_calls attribute of your response.**\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The actual tool results in will be provided to you after the tool call is executed, with the role of the message being 'tool'.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n\n# Agent Specific Objective\n\nYou are an agent that specializes in analyzing and predicting events in **finance**.\n\n## File Path Handling\nWhen subtasks mention file paths, these are local system file paths (not sandbox paths). You can:\n- Use tools to directly access these files from the local system\n- Upload files to the sandbox environment (remember to create a new sandbox for each task, this sandbox only exists for the current task) for processing if needed\n- Choose the most appropriate approach based on the specific task requirements\n- If the final response requires returning a file, download it to the local system first and then return the local path, the sandbox path is not allowed\n\nCritically assess the reliability of all information:\n- If the credibility of a source is uncertain, clearly flag it.\n- Do **not** treat information as trustworthy just because it appears — **cross-check when necessary**.\n- If you find conflicting or ambiguous information, include all relevant findings and flag the inconsistency.\n\nBe cautious and transparent in your output:\n- Always return all related information. If information is incomplete or weakly supported, still share partial excerpts, and flag any uncertainty.\n- Never assume or guess — if an exact answer cannot be found, say so clearly.\n- Prefer quoting or excerpting **original source text** rather than interpreting or rewriting it, and provide the URL if available.\n- If more context is needed, return a clarification request and do not proceed with tool use.\n- Focus on completing the specific subtask assigned to you, not broader reasoning.\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}

Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Main Post Content**:  \n   - The post lists \"Amazon [#AMZN]\" among the most anticipated earnings releases but provides **no numerical data** (e.g., whisper numbers, consensus EPS, guidance, or forecasts) for Amazon.  \n   - Example: \"The most anticipated earnings releases for the week of February 2, 2026, are Palantir Technologies [#PLTR], Amazon [#AMZN], AMD [#AMD], Alphabet [#GOOGL], PayPal [#PYPL], IREN Ltd [#IREN], Teradyne [#TER], Arm Holdings [#ARM], and Uber Technologies [#UBER].\"  \n   - No quantitative details follow this list.\n\n2. **Image Content**:  \n   - **Image 1**: Alt text states \"May be an image of text\" but contains **no visible text or data** in the provided description.  \n   - **YouTube Thumbnail (Image 4)**: Described as \"The Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for the Week of February 2, 2206\" (note: year appears to be a typo for 2026), but the **actual content of the video is not accessible** from the post. No specific AMZN numbers are included in the alt text or visible description.  \n   - Other images (e.g., \"Image 2\", \"Image 3\", etc.) have **no alt text or visible text provided** beyond generic references (e.g., \"blob:http://localhost/...\").  \n\n3. **Comments Section**:  \n   - Multiple comments mention Amazon generically (e.g., Erich Köppel: \"Palantir, Pepsi, Novo Nordisk, Alphabet, Amazon\" in a prediction about \"Gute Zahlen -> Absturz -> Nachkauf\"), but **no specific earnings numbers or whisper data** are provided.  \n   - All comments focus on general sentiment (e.g., \"PayPal will beat earnings\", \"hope someone does not destroy it again\") without quantifying Amazon’s expected results.  \n\n4. **Linked Resources**:  \n   - The post includes a link to `https://www.earningswhispers.com/calendar` and a YouTube video (`https://youtu.be/v1o4f_diq14`), but **neither the calendar page nor the video content is accessible** in the provided data.  \n   - No text snippets from these external resources are included in the post.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \n- **No AMZN-specific whisper number or consensus EPS** is directly stated in the text, images, or comments of the provided post.  \n- Any data that might exist in linked resources (e.g., earningswhispers.com calendar, YouTube video) **cannot be verified** from the current content, as the post only references these links without embedding the actual data.  \n- If the key information resides in images or linked content, it is **not accessible without login or additional tools**, and the provided alt text/visible text contains no actionable numbers for AMZN.  \n\n**Final Answer**: No AMZN-specific whisper numbers or consensus EPS data is present in this post.", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}

Analysts and investors should assume standard practice (e.g., EPS surprises often use non-GAAP figures excluding special items), but the page itself lacks transparency on this detail.  \n\n---  \n**Additional Notes**:  \n- **Revenue Forecast Discrepancy**: The FAQ states \"Revenue forecast is $175.38B\", but the table shows a $211.27B forecast for the Feb 05, 2026 report (Q4 2025). This suggests the FAQ may reference a different quarter or outdated data.  \n- **Pro Features Required**: More granular analyst data (e.g., count, high/low ranges) requires an InvestingPro subscription (indicated by \"Unlock InvestingPro\" prompts).  \n- **Market Reaction**: The Oct 30, 2025 report showed a +25% EPS surprise but stock fell 3.23% in after-hours trading due to \"special charges\" (FTC settlement, severance costs).", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}

Changes in foreign exchange rates increased net sales by $1.5 billion for Q3 2025, and by $1.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. For a discussion of the effect of foreign exchange rates on sales growth, see \"Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates\" below.\n\nNorth America sales increased 11% in Q3 2025, and 10% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and subscription services. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued focus on price, selection, and convenience for our customers, including from our fast shipping offers. Changes in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact North America net sales for Q3 2025, but reduced North America net sales by $611 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\n\nInternational sales increased 14% in Q3 2025, and 12% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and subscription services. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued focus on price, selection, and convenience for our customers, including from our fast shipping offers. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased International net sales by $1.5 billion for Q3 2025, and by $2.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\n```\n\n### From Item 2: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates\n\n```\nInformation regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. The effect on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income from changes in our foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions):\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,    Nine Months Ended September 30,\n            2024      2025      2024      2025\nAs Reported     Exchange Rate Effect (1)    At Prior Year Rates(2)    As Reported     Exchange Rate Effect (1)    At Prior Year Rates(2)    As Reported     Exchange Rate Effect (1)    At Prior Year Rates(2)    As Reported     Exchange Rate Effect (1)    At Prior Year Rates(2)\nNet sales    $158,877    $233    $159,110    $180,169    $(1,511)    $178,658    $450,167    $1,438    $451,605    $503,538    $(1,586)    $501,952\nOperating expenses    141,466    249    141,715    162,747    (1,382)    161,365    402,777    1,555    404,332    448,540    (1,251)    447,289\nOperating income    17,411    (16)    17,395    17,422    (129)    17,293    47,390    (117)    47,273    54,998    (335)    54,663\n```\n\n### From Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Exchange Risk\n\n```\nDuring Q3 2025, net sales from our International segment accounted for 23% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the period compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales in Q3 2025 increased by $1.5 billion in comparison with Q3 2024.\n\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (\"foreign funds\"). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of September 30, 2025, of $20.4 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in declines of $1.0 billion, $2.0 billion, and $4.1 billion.\n\nWe also have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of September 30, 2025, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of $350 million, $700 million, and $1.4 billion, recorded to \"Other income (expense), net.\"\n```", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}
