{"role": "system", "content": "\n# General Objective\n\nYou accomplish a given task iteratively, breaking it down into clear steps and working through them methodically.\n\n## Task Strategy\n\n1. Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, carefully review and extract all potentially relevant information, details, or implications from the tool result before proceeding. The user won't provide any tool-use feedback. You must reflect on the results, and revise your plan if needed by yourself. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked or missed.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n5. No matter what the user requests, please always gather information and analyze as much as possible, before providing an answer.\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. **IMPORTANT: Each response must involve one tool call, unless the task is already solved. Sending back a response without a tool call is STRICTLY forbidden, unless the task is already solved.**\n2. **IMPORTANT: After each tool call, you must pause, think and reflect the results, your current plan, and take the next step. You may modify your plan according to the tool call results provided to you.**\n3. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n4. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n5. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n6. **For historical or time-specific content**: Regular search engines return current webpage content, not historical content. Archived webpage search is essential for retrieving content as it appeared in the past, use related tools to search for the historical content.\n7. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, thoroughly extract and summarize all partial information, important details, patterns, constraints, or keywords that may help guide future steps. Never proceed to the next step without first ensuring that all significant insights from the current result have been fully considered.\n8. **IMPORTANT: Do include the tool call with the tool_calls in your response sent back, as a dedicated item in your response, which follows the OpenAI's tool call communication rules. Note that it is NOT in the text content of your response that you should include your tool_calls, but in the tool_calls attribute of your response.**\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. **CRITICAL: Do not include tool results, do not assume what the results will be, and do not continue with additional analysis or tool calls. The actual tool results in will be provided to you after the tool call is executed, with the role of the message being 'tool'.**\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}

Yes\nB. No\n\nAs of market creation, Amazon is estimated to release earnings on February 5, 2026. The Street consensus estimate for Amazon's GAAP EPS for the relevant quarter is $1.95 as of market creation. This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Amazon reports GAAP EPS greater than $1.95 for the relevant quarter in its next quarterly earnings release. Otherwise, it will resolve to \"No.\" The resolution source will be the GAAP EPS listed in the company’s official earnings documents. \n\nIf Amazon releases earnings without GAAP EPS, then the market will resolve according to the GAAP EPS figure reported by SeekingAlpha. If no such figure is published within 96h of market close (4:00:00pm ET) on the day earnings are announced, the market will resolve to “No”.\n\nIf the company does not release earnings within 45 calendar days of the estimated earnings date, this market will resolve to “No.” \n\nNote: Subsequent restatements, corrections, or revisions made to the initially announced GAAP EPS figure will not qualify for resolution, except in the case of obvious and immediate mistakes (e.g., fat finger errors, as with Lyft's (LYFT) earnings release in February 2024).\nNote: The strike prices used in these markets are derived from SeekingAlpha estimates, and reflect the consensus of sell-side analyst estimates for GAAP EPS. \nNote: All figures will be rounded to the nearest cent using standard rounding.\nNote: For the purposes of this market, IFRS EPS will be treated as GAAP EPS.\nNote: For the purposes of this market, GAAP EPS refers to diluted GAAP EPS, unless this is not published, in which case it refers to basic GAAP EPS.\nNote: All figures are expressed in USD, unless otherwise indicated.\nNote: For primarily internationally listed companies, this market refers specifically to the shares traded in the United States on U.S. stock exchanges such as the NYSE or Nasdaq. In cases where the company trades in the U.S. through an American Depositary Receipt (ADR) or American Depositary Share (ADS), this market will refer to the ADR/ADS.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nYour goal is to identify the single correct option based on your analysis.\n\nNOTE: If you notice a potential time conflict in the question, do not worry—this may be due to different time zones, and it can still refer to the same moment in time.\n\nIMPORTANT: Your final answer MUST end with this exact format:\n\\boxed{A} or \\boxed{B}\n\nDo not use any other format. Do not refuse to make a prediction. Do not say \"I cannot predict the future.\" You must make a clear prediction based on the best data currently available, using the box format specified above.\n\nYour task is to comprehensively address the question by actively collecting detailed information from the web, and generating a thorough, transparent report. Your goal is NOT to rush a single definitive answer or conclusion, but rather to gather complete information and present ALL plausible candidate answers you find, accompanied by clearly documented supporting evidence, reasoning steps, uncertainties, and explicit intermediate findings.\n\nUser does not intend to set traps or create confusion on purpose. Handle the task using the most common, reasonable, and straightforward interpretation, and do not overthink or focus on rare or far-fetched interpretations.\n\nImportant considerations:\n- Collect comprehensive information from reliable sources to understand all aspects of the question.\n- Present every possible candidate answer identified during your information gathering, regardless of uncertainty, ambiguity, or incomplete verification. Avoid premature conclusions or omission of any discovered possibility.\n- Explicitly document detailed facts, evidence, and reasoning steps supporting each candidate answer, carefully preserving intermediate analysis results.\n- Clearly flag and retain any uncertainties, conflicting interpretations, or alternative understandings identified during information gathering. Do not arbitrarily discard or resolve these issues on your own.\n- If the question's explicit instructions (e.g., numeric precision, formatting, specific requirements) appear inconsistent, unclear, erroneous, or potentially mismatched with general guidelines or provided examples, explicitly record and clearly present all plausible interpretations and corresponding candidate answers.  \n\nRecognize that the original task description might itself contain mistakes, imprecision, inaccuracies, or conflicts introduced unintentionally by the user due to carelessness, misunderstanding, or limited expertise. Do NOT try to second-guess or \"correct\" these instructions internally; instead, transparently present findings according to every plausible interpretation.\n\nYour objective is maximum completeness, transparency, and detailed documentation to empower the user to judge and select their preferred answer independently. Even if uncertain, explicitly documenting the existence of possible answers significantly enhances the user's experience, ensuring no plausible solution is irreversibly omitted due to early misunderstanding or premature filtering.\n", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}

**$1.95** as of market creation.”  \n  and:  \n  > “The strike prices used in these markets are derived from **SeekingAlpha estimates**, and reflect the consensus of sell-side analyst estimates for

https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/amzn/research-ratings?mod=quotes\n\n**Interpretation for the $1.95 line:** The most GAAP-explicit consensus values available in-session cluster around **~$1.96–$1.97**, i.e., **just above** $1.95, with a wide distribution shown by FactSet via Barron’s (**$1.61–$2.41**).\n\n---\n\n## 2) **Last 12 quarters**: GAAP EPS actual vs consensus & surprise

estimate on the same GAAP table\n- Finviz shows for **2025Q4** (Report date **Feb 5, 2026**): **Estimated EPS = 1.9697** (Actual blank/not yet).  \nCitation: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN&ty=fc\n\n---\n\n## 3) Long-run GAAP EPS beat/miss frequency (web-sourced)\n\n### 3.1 Beat/miss rate from the accessible Finviz GAAP history (2019Q1–2025Q3)\nUsing the Finviz GAAP EPS table entries visible in-session (2019Q1 through 2025Q3):\n\n- **Beats:** 20  \n- **Misses:** 7  \n- **Meets:** 0  \n- **Total quarters counted:** 27  \n- **Beat rate:** ~**74%**  \n- **Most recent GAAP beat streak implied by that table:** **11 consecutive beats** (from **2023Q1** through **2025Q3**, with **2022Q4** a miss).  \nUnderlying source table: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN&ty=fc\n\n### 3.2 Conflicting “streak” claim found (not GAAP-specified)\nA Nasdaq-hosted Motley Fool–syndicated article states:\n> “Amazon has a **12-quarter** streak of beating Wall Street’s earnings-per-share estimates.”  \nIt does **not** specify GAAP vs adjusted, and it conflicts with the Finviz GAAP table’s implication (11 straight GAAP beats because 2022Q4 was a GAAP miss there).  \nCitation: https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-you-buy-amazon-stock-feb-5-0\n\n**Conclusion:** Beat-rate evidence is strong, but “streak length” is **dataset/definition-sensitive** (GAAP vs adjusted; provider differences).\n\n---\n\n## 4) Guidance / management commentary relevant to FY2025 Q4 GAAP EPS\n\n### 4.1 Official Q4 FY2025 Outlook from Amazon’s Q3 FY2025 release (Business Wire)\nKey guidance that directly informs GAAP operating income (and indirectly EPS), plus explicit FX assumption:\n\n- Net sales:\n  > “Net sales are expected to be between **$206.0 billion and $213.0 billion**… This guidance anticipates a **favorable impact of approximately 190 basis points from foreign exchange rates**.”  \n- Operating income:\n  > “Operating income is expected to be between **$21.0 billion and $26.0 billion**…”  \n- Guidance caveat on one-time items:\n  > “This guidance assumes… that **no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements** are concluded.”  \nCitation: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251029099339/en/Amazon.com-Announces-Third-Quarter-Results\n\nAlso on Q3 diluted EPS (helps anchor run-rate expectations):\n> “Net income increased to $21.2 billion in the third quarter, or **$1.95 per diluted share**…”  \nCitation: same Business Wire link above.\n\n### 4.2 CNBC management commentary context (Q3 FY2025 results; Q4 guidance; one-time charges)\nCNBC (Oct 30, 2025) reiterates Q4 ranges and notes Q3 operating income included large discrete charges:\n\n- Q4 sales: **$206B–$213B**  \n- Q4 operating income: **$21B–$26B**  \n- Q3 included:\n  > “$2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission”  \n  and:\n  > “about $1.8 billion in severance costs…”  \n- Also notes guidance uncertainty from tariffs/trade policy (qualitative risk factor).  \nCitation: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/amazon-amzn-q3-earnings-report-2025.html\n\n### 4.3 Reuters summary extracted in-session (conflict flagged)\nA Reuters page read during the session stated Q4 net sales guidance **$206B–$213B** and referenced one-time charges, but the extracted summary included a **“$25 billion” FTC settlement charge**, which **directly conflicts** with CNBC and Business Wire (both indicate **$2.5B**, not $25B).  \nBecause of that inconsistency, treat the Reuters-extracted “$25B” figure as **likely erroneous in the accessible extract** and **not reliable** versus CNBC/Business Wire.  \n(Reuters link that was read: https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-forecasts-quarterly-revenue-largely-below-estimates-2025-10-30/ )\n\n---\n\n## 5) Notable one-time / volatile GAAP EPS swing factors (with citations)\n\n### 5.1 Rivian equity valuation and other “Other income (expense), net” volatility (10-K)\nAmazon’s FY2024 10-K provides explicit detail that “Other income (expense), net” is heavily driven by **equity security valuations** (including Rivian) and **FX**, which can swing GAAP net income/EPS.\n\nFrom the 10-K (yearly data, but mechanism directly affects quarterly GAAP):\n- “Other income (expense), net… primary components… related to equity securities valuations and adjustments… and foreign currency.”  \n- “Included… in 2023 and 2024… a… valuation gain (loss)… from our equity investment in **Rivian**.”  \n- Quantification:\n  > “Included in other income (expense), net in 2023 and 2024 is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of **$797 million** and **$(1.6) billion** from our equity investment in Rivian.”  \n- Component table excerpt (millions):\n  - Marketable equity securities valuation gains (losses): **$(13,870)** (2022), **$984** (2023), **$(1,278)** (2024)  \n  - Foreign currency gains (losses): **$(340)** (2022), **$65** (2023), **$(408)** (2024)  \n  - Total other income (expense), net: **$(16,806)** (2022), **$938** (2023), **$(2,250)** (2024)  \nCitation: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872425000004/amzn-20241231.htm\n\n**Relevance:** Even if Q4 operating results are strong, GAAP diluted EPS can be pushed above/below $1.95 by **below-the-line** valuation/FX effects.\n\n### 5.2 FX exposure (including remeasurement of intercompany balances)\nSame 10-K highlights:\n- “Changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results…”  \n- “Remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses…”  \n- Quantified sensitivity example (intercompany balances):\n  > “an assumed 10% adverse change… would result in losses of **$605 million**, recorded to ‘Other income (expense), net.’”  \nCitation: same SEC 10-K link above.\n\nAlso Q4 guidance assumes **~190 bps favorable FX impact** to net sales (Business Wire).  \nCitation: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251029099339/en/Amazon.com-Announces-Third-Quarter-Results\n\n### 5.3 Restructuring/severance and legal settlements\n- Q3 FY2025 included **$1.8B severance** and **$2.5B FTC settlement** (CNBC).  \nCitation: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/amazon-amzn-q3-earnings-report-2025.html\n- Q4 guidance explicitly assumes **no additional… restructurings, or legal settlements** (Business Wire).  \nCitation: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251029099339/en/Amazon.com-Announces-Third-Quarter-Results\n- The 10-K describes restructuring charge types (impairments, lease terminations, severance) and extensive legal proceedings that can create episodic GAAP hits.  \nCitation: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872425000004/amzn-20241231.htm\n\n---\n\n## 6) What this implies for the **“GAAP diluted EPS > $1.95”** question (evidence-based synthesis)\n\n**Evidence pointing toward “Yes” (but close):**\n- The most GAAP-explicit consensus values found (Seeking Alpha GAAP estimate **$1.96**; Finviz GAAP estimate **1.9697**) are **slightly above** $1.95.  \n  - SA: https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN/earnings  \n  - Finviz: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN&ty=fc\n- Long-run GAAP beat frequency from an accessible GAAP dataset is strong (**~74% beats** since 2019Q1) with a recent GAAP beat streak (**11 straight** per Finviz GAAP table).  \n  - Finviz: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN&ty=fc\n- Q4 operating income guidance is high (**$21B–$26B**) and includes a stated FX tailwind (**~190 bps** to net sales).  \n  - Business Wire: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251029099339/en/Amazon.com-Announces-Third-Quarter-Results\n\n**Evidence increasing uncertainty / “No” risk:**\n- The threshold is **tight**: consensus centers around **~$1.96–$1.97**, so relatively modest negative variance can flip the outcome.\n- GAAP EPS can be materially affected by **Rivian valuation**, **FX remeasurement**, and **legal/restructuring** items (10-K).  \n  - SEC 10-K: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872425000004/amzn-20241231.htm\n- Some sources (MarketBeat, Zacks) cite similar EPS levels but do **not** clearly specify GAAP vs adjusted, limiting their direct comparability to a GAAP-diluted threshold.\n\n**Educated guess based on the session’s evidence:** **Slightly more likely than not (“Lean Yes”)**, but it is a **near-consensus coin-flip** because estimates cluster just above **$1.95** and GAAP volatility items can swing results.\n\n---\n\n## 7) Data access issues / missing items (important for downstream work)\nDuring this session, several “major source” pages were not retrievable in full due to access restrictions:\n- **Yahoo Finance AMZN “Analysis” page** (often includes avg/low/high and analyst count) returned HTTP errors in this run, despite Google snippets showing “Low 1.61 / High 2.41 / Avg 1.96” style fields.\n- **TipRanks** pages returned **403/CAPTCHA**.\n- **Investing.com** earnings/analysis pages returned **403/CAPTCHA**.\n- **Nasdaq AMZN quote page** showed “data currently not available” for earnings forecast fields (in the retrieved content).\n- **Yahoo Finance quoteSummary API endpoint** returned **401 Unauthorized (Invalid Crumb)**, so programmatic earningsTrend extraction failed.\n\n---\n\n# Full working trajectory (actions taken + outcomes)\n\nBelow is the complete trajectory of what was done and what was found, in chronological order (described generically without internal tool naming):\n\n1) **Web search** for “AMZN Feb 5 2026 GAAP EPS consensus

long-run dataset (**~74%** since 2019Q1).  \n- However, **GAAP EPS volatility** from **Rivian valuation**, **FX remeasurement**, and **legal/restructuring** items can overwhelm small margins around a $1.95 threshold.  \n\n**Therefore:** **Lean Yes**, but **tight**.", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}

Attempted to read the Finviz page via a text-extraction endpoint; it failed due to **context length**.\n4. In sandbox Python, fetched Finviz HTML successfully (**HTTP 200**, ~1.9MB). `pandas.read_html` tables did not directly expose the EPS table, but the HTML contained embedded JSON under `route-init-data`.\n5. Parsed the embedded JSON `earningsData` into a dataframe; filtered **2019+**; computed:\n   - **N=27** usable quarters,\n   - **beat rate = 0.7407407**,\n   - distribution stats, percentiles,\n   - **P_emp(S>-0.01) = 0.7407407**,\n   - winsorized-normal probabilities (**0.7901** at 5–95%, **0.8267** at 10–90%),\n   - identified worst negative surprises (notably **2022Q1, 2022Q2**).\n6. Web searched and extracted Amazon IR press releases for Q1’22 and Q2’22:\n   - Q1’22: **$7.6B** pre-tax Rivian valuation loss cited.\n   - Q2’22: **$3.9B** pre-tax Rivian valuation loss cited.\n7. Found and extracted Amazon IR Q4’22 release text:\n   - **$2.3B** Rivian valuation loss cited,\n   - **~$2.7B** charges (self-insurance estimate changes, impairments, severance) cited.\n8. Checked AlphaQuery’s earnings history page: it explicitly uses EPS “before non-recurring items” (non-GAAP), so not used for GAAP surprises.\n9. Tried to visually extract Finviz “GAAP EPS Performance and Forecast” table: the rendered snapshot was blocked by Cloudflare, so the literal heading couldn’t be captured that way.\n10. Checked MarketChameleon’s EPS results table: it did not clearly label GAAP vs non-GAAP in the extracted page content, so it wasn’t used as the primary GAAP dataset.\n\n---\n\n## Final computed answers (requested items)\n**(1) Empirical beat/miss rate (2019Q1–2025Q3, N=27):**\n- Beat (surprise>0): **74.1%** (20 beats / 7 misses)\n\n**(2) Surprise distribution (Actual−Estimate, $):**\n- mean **0.1637**, median **0.2064**, stdev **0.3344**, skew **0.1418**\n- percentiles: p01 **−0.6716**, p05 **−0.2673**, p10 **−0.1421**, p25 **0.02145**, p50 **0.2064**, p75 **0.32775**, p90 **0.3751**, p95 **0.42391**, p99 **1.0084** (min **−0.7955**, max **1.2074**)\n\n**(3) P(Actual ≥ 1.95 | consensus 1.96) ⇔ P(surprise > −0.01):**\n- (a) empirical CDF: **0.7407**\n- (b) robust fitted (winsorized normal):\n  - winsor 5–95%: **0.7901**\n  - winsor 10–90% (sensitivity): **0.8267**\n\n**Large negative GAAP surprises & causes (with citations):**\n- 2022Q1: large negative surprise; **Rivian MTM valuation loss $7.6B pre-tax** (Amazon IR Q1’22)\n- 2022Q2: large negative surprise; **Rivian MTM valuation loss $3.9B pre-tax** (Amazon IR Q2’22)\n- 2022Q4: negative surprise; **Rivian valuation loss $2.3B pre-tax** + **~$2.7B impairments/severance/self-insurance estimate charges** (Amazon IR Q4’22)", "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}}

Dec 2025): 1.96**  \n  Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/analysis/\n\n**Consensus GAAP EPS immediately before release (from both sources): $1.96.**\n\n---\n\n## Supporting evidence (official publication checks)\n\n### A) Amazon IR “Quarterly Results” page\nResult: **Q4 2025 not posted**; most recent quarter shown was **Q3 2025**.\n\n- The page content (as captured in-session) listed **Q3 2025, Q2 2025, Q1 2025**, then rolled to **2024** — **no Q4 2025 section** present.  \nSource: https://ir.aboutamazon.com/quarterly-results/default.aspx\n\nThis was used as primary evidence that official Q4 2025 results materials (release PDF/shareholder letter) were **not yet posted** at the time of checking.\n\n### B) AboutAmazon “earnings report” article\nResult: The AboutAmazon page located was **an announcement of the upcoming release**, not the actual results; it contained **no EPS**.\n\n- Quote captured from AboutAmazon context:\n  - “**Amazon will share its Q4 and 2025 financial results on February 5**”\n  - “Amazon will hold a conference call to discuss its Q4 2025 and full year 2025 financial results on February 5 at **2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET**.”  \nSource (AboutAmazon earnings announcement page): https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-earnings-q4-2025-report\n\nAlso, another AboutAmazon page (“Update on our organization”) explicitly linked to the earnings announcement page:\n- Quote found: “**Amazon will share its Q4 and 2025 financial results on February 5**”  \nSource: https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-layoffs-corporate-jan-2026?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&stream=top  \nLink it provided: https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-earnings-q4-2025-report\n\n### C) Amazon IR “Announces Fourth Quarter Results” release page\nResult: Attempted likely URL for a 2026-dated “Announces Fourth Quarter Results” page returned **404 / Page Not Found** (so no EPS extracted there).  \nAttempted URL (404 in-session): https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2026/Amazon-com-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-Results/default.aspx\n\n### D) SEC EDGAR 8‑K check (earnings exhibit)\nResult: The SEC listing retrieval attempt (CIK 1018724, type 8‑K) **did not show any Feb 2026 filing within the captured output**; the summary indicated the newest visible entry was **Nov 20, 2025** and therefore **no Q4 2025 earnings 8‑K exhibit link could be extracted** from that captured page output.  \nSource queried: https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=1018724&type=8-K&count=40&owner=exclude\n\n**Caution / limitation:** this outcome reflects what was returned in-session from that page fetch and may have been incomplete or affected by retrieval limitations; however, within this session, **no SEC 8‑K earnings exhibit for Q4 2025 was successfully identified/extracted**.\n\n---\n\n## Verified event timing (ET/PT)\n\n### Amazon IR press release (Jan 22, 2026)\nExtracted line:\n> “... will hold a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter 2025 financial results on **Thursday, February 5, 2026, at 2:00 p.m. PT/5:00 p.m. ET**.”  \nSource: https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2026/Amazon-com-to-Webcast-Fourth-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-Conference-Call/default.aspx\n\n### Amazon IR Events page\nEvent listing captured:\n- “**Q4 2025 Amazon.com, Inc.
